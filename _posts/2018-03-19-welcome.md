Hello! Welcome to my blog! It's a bit bare right now with a name that's more of a placeholder at the moment. Hopefully that will change as I brush up on **Jekyll**.

The main purpose of this blog is to post snippets of code I find interesting or useful. Usually these will be my forays into learning new programming languages or just code that I encounter while working as a programmer. I'll begin the post with a snippet of code and then discuss the particulars of what makes that code so _fascinating_.

So onto the code at hand! 

We have a Scheme snippet which simply prints out the phrase "Hello world" to standard output. I think it's a fitting message for a blogger starting out. :-)
